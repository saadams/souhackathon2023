# Hackathon 2023 Project (RNN text generation)

This project is an example of a RNN(Recurrent neural network) used to create a shakespear sonnet after learning from some examples of his work. 
This model is contained in a terminal and will output the results to the terminal.
This model was created in python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. 
TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/
Keras: https://keras.io/

### Python basics for running files:
https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/


### Installation Instructions:
After cloning or saving the files to your computer.
The easiest way to to install dependencies is to run the program install_instructions.py alternativly the instructions for installation are below.

Mac Users:
* Mac users follow the instructions found here for installing tensorflow: https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/
* Mac users can run this following command in the project dir. 'pip install -r requirements_mac.txt'

Windows Users:
* Windows users can run the following command in the project dir.  'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
* Windows users can find additional instructions to install tensorflow provided here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#cpu 


Linux Users:
*Linux users can run the following command in the project dir.  'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
*Follow the instructions here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux' 


### How to use
After saving the files to your computer and installing all dependencies run the gen_text.py file and follow along the prompts.

The computer will ask how many times you want to train the bot which will affect its accuracy, the higher the number the better the accuracy but the longer and more intensive it is.

After the bot is done "learning" it will ask you to start a sonnet which it will then finish after some time to process.
